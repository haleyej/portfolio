          <h2>welcome!</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Haley! I'm a junior at the University of Michigan majoring in information science
            with minors in statistics and digital studes. I love that I get to study technology, 
            data science, and digital culture – I really struggled to choose a major (in an alternate 
            universe I was a data scientist or pre-health or pre-law or.....) but I'm glad
            I landed on this. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am originally from Manistee, Michigan, a small town up north. I grew up a few blocks
            away from Lake Michigan and spent my childhood swimming, hiking, and watching lots of sunsets
            on the beach. I firmly believe Northwest Michigan is one of the best places in the world to live.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first started coding in 9th grade when I taught myself how to do fun animations in JavaScript (which
            are unfortunately (maybe thankfully??) no longer avaliable due my high school deactivating my old Google account). 
            I've always loved creating things and diving into personal projects, but now I create things
            that are slightly more advanced than JavaScript animations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next summer, I will be joining Meta (formerly known as Facebook) as a 
            product growth analyst intern in their Menlo Park office. I can't wait to combine my data science skills
            and product sense to improve user experience.
